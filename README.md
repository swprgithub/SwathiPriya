## CROP YIELD
## Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models:
CropYield is a project focused on predicting future crop yields using machine learning and deep learning algorithms based on historical weather data such as temperature and rainfall. This prediction can help farmers make informed decisions before sowing, ultimately improving crop management and yield outcomes.
## Abstract
In this project, we utilize machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict future crop yields. By analyzing historical weather data, farmers can be informed about potential crop yields before sowing, enabling them to make better decisions. The project uses the Irish Maize and Potato yield dataset to train various machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) scores, where a lower MSE and higher R2 indicate better predictive accuracy.
## Features
* Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Random Forest, SVR, and other machine learning models.
* Deep Learning Models: Implementation of ANN, DNN, CNN, and LSTM for advanced predictive analysis.
* Performance Evaluation: Calculation of MSE and R2 scores to assess the accuracy of each model.
* Dataset: Utilizes Irish Maize and Potato yield datasets.
